			<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Welcome! This is your go-to spot for getting to know football through numbers.
			 Every move, every score, and every plan in football is full of details, and we're here to show you just that.
			 We take a good look at all the stats that play a huge part in football but aren't always seen.
			 The way we use numbers has really changed the game. We keep a close eye on how players and teams perform and this helps us see patterns that might otherwise be missed. With stats, teams get better at what they do, talent scouts find the next big stars, and fans get to know the game like never before.
			 We've got lots of stats to share with you, each one adding to the big story of football. Stick with us as we dig into all sorts of stats and put them into pictures and charts that make it easy to see how football works.</p>
